# Problem: Given n flowers to pick and m flower types (each with initial happiness a[i] and bonus b[i] per extra flower), choose exactly n flowers to maximize total happiness.
#
# Approach: Sort flower types by descending b[i] (bonus value), try picking each type as the main one, and simulate filling remaining flowers with the best a[i] values using a prefix sum.
#
# Why: You only need to consider top m best a[i] values and simulate placing the current type's flowers last â€” reducing the search to O(m log m) per test case.
